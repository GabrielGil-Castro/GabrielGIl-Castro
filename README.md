# HELLO EVERYBODY!

## About Me

As a native of the region of Rio de Janeiro, I have always been passionate about exploring the world around me. Before obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Social Science, I spent years honing my craft in theater, which has given me a unique perspective on the human experience. My insatiable curiosity has led me to explore a range of subjects, from art to technology passing by social ciences. I am always eager to learn and to engage with new challenges, and I believe that my diverse background makes me well-suited to a wide range of opportunities.

- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm exploring JavaScript/ Typescript, Front-End and Back-End languages, React.js, Node.js, RTL, POO.
- ðŸ“š I'm learning more about Agile methodologies, Java and Python.
