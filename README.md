# HELLO EVERYBODY!

## About Me

As a native of the region of Rio de Janeiro, I have always been passionate about exploring the world around me.

My insatiable curiosity has led me to explore a range of subjects, from art to technology passing by social ciences. I am always eager to learn and to engage with new challenges, and I believe that my diverse background makes me well-suited to a wide range of opportunities.
